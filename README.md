   * Color based: threshold using brown color.
   * Otsu's method: threshold using all colors.
 * Use watershed: use watershed algorithm to segment regions.
 * Use convex hull: ignore curves that are bulged inside.
 * Minimum cell area: cells smaller than this will be ignored.
 * Save analysis results: save analysis results as text files when using Process All.
 * Save segmented image: save segmented images when using Process All.

### Output parameters
 * Area: cell area.
 * Perimeter: cell perimeter.
 * Distance: distance from the largest cell.
